# TC 2025 Advanced Programming Class

Description:

This is a course in advanced programming using the C language. You will design and program solutions using the UNIX API along with memory management, concurrent processes & threads, and sockets.

This repository contains all the class examples and the assignments (to be added later). The code will be migrated from the Schoology class site, but for the moment the code is in both places. However, be advised that the Github version is up to date and that the code in Schoology will be removed later on the semester.
